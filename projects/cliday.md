**Tip of the week:** Make Zsh help more helpful

Zsh does not enable a builtin `help` command, instead it provides `run-help`. By default `run-help` is an alias to `man` and will only work on external commands. To use it for Zsh builtins and features, load and unalias the command in your `.zshrc`.

```sh
autoload -Uz run-help
unalias run-help
alias help=run-help # for convenience
```

For example, you can now run `help whence`, `help history`, etc.

**Tip of the week:** Remove duplicate lines without sorting

If you have data with duplicate lines but don't want to change the order, try `awk '!a[$0]++'`! For example:

```sh
% cat << EOF > file1
Apple
Orange
Orange
Banana
Apple
Pineapple
EOF

% awk '!a[$0]++' file1
Apple
Orange
Banana
Pineapple
```

How does this work? You can read a wonderful walkthrough at [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/remove-duplicate-lines-files-awk).

% cat << EOF > file2
HEADER2
Value-1
Value-2
EOF

% paste file1 file2
HEADER1 HEADER2
Data-1  Value-1
Date-2  Value-2
```

% echo "2: file ending with a newline" > 2.txt

% cat *.txt
1: file ending with no newline2: file ending with a newline

1: file ending with no newline

2: file ending with a newline

% awk 'FNR==2{print ""}1' *.txt
1: file ending with no newline
2: file ending with a newline
```

**Tip of the week:** Use `awk` to increment a semantic version number

Split the string by a period character, and `$NF` will represent the last segment of the version number. The output field separator is also set to a period character so the return string is in semver format. For example:

```sh
% echo "3.6" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$NF++;print}'
3.7

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$NF++;print}'
3.6.14

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$(NF-1)++;print}'
3.7.13

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -F. '{$(NF-2)++;print $1}'
4
```

**Tip of the week:** Use `openssl` for quick-and-dirty file encryption

Example:

```sh
% echo "My plaintext file." > /tmp/file1.txt

# Using the default macOS LibreSSL (results in a binary file):
% openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in /tmp/file1.txt -out /tmp/file1.enc
% openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in /tmp/file1.enc -out /tmp/file1.txt

# Using OpenSSL from Homebrew (results in a more secure, base64 text file):
% /usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin/openssl enc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -aes256 -salt -base64 \
  -in /tmp/file1.txt -out /tmp/file1.enc
% /usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin/openssl enc -d -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -aes256 -base64 \
  -in /tmp/file1.enc -out /tmp/file1.txt
```

**Tip of the week:** You can avoid manually working with temp files by using ZSH process substitution:

Example:

```sh
% echo "Banana\nApple\nCucumber" > /path/to/file1
% sort /path/to/file1 > /path/to/file1 # Fails!

# Solution with a temp file:
% temp1=$(mktemp)
% sort /path/to/file1 > "$temp1"
% mv "$temp1" /path/to/file1

# Solution with process substitution:
% mv =(sort /path/to/file1) /path/to/file1
```

**Tip of the week:** Quickly retrieve a deleted file from a Git repository:

```sh
% file="./repo/path/to/file"
git checkout $(git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- "$file")~1 -- "$file"
```

Don't know the full path of the file?

```sh
% filename="filename"
% sha="$(git log --all --full-history -1 --format=%H -- "**/$filename.*")" && \
  git checkout "$sha"~1 -- "$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r "$sha" | grep "$filename")"

**Tip of the week:** Move around directories quickly with various Zsh builtin methods:

```sh
# Return immediately to the previous directory:
% cd -

# With zsh, enable auto_cd [in ~/.zshrc] to move around without `cd`:
% setopt auto_cd
% .. # Go up a directory
% ../foo # Go up a directory and enter the 'foo' directory
% ../.. # Go up two directories

# Set a "bookmarked" directory once auto_cd is enabled:
% cdpath=(/path/to/important_directory)
% cd important_directory/subdirectory

# Keep a running list of directories visited:
% setopt auto_pushd
% cd /usr/local/bin; cd ~/.local/bin; cd ~/.config/gcloud
% echo $dirstack # See your directory stack
% cd -2 # Jump to element '2' in the stack (counting from the right, starting at zero)
% cd +1 # Jump to element '1' in the stack (counting from the left, starting at zero)

# Now the fun begins:
% setopt pushd_ignore_dups # Prevent duplicates in the stack
% cd "$(printf '%s\n' "${dirstack[@]}" | fzf)"
```

**Tip of the week:** How to batch install Homebrew packages for a quick bootstrap:

```sh
# On the existing system, dump all installed packages (taps, formulas, casks, and app store):

% brew bundle install
# To keep your system up-to-date using this method check out:
% brew bundle --help
# Pair this with `stow` to quickly install dotfiles and get a new system running in no time!

**Tip of the week:** Use Python as a simple `jq` replacement:

```sh
foo='{"cities": {"boston": "ma", "miami": "fl", "seattle": "wa"}}'
python -c "import sys, json;print(json.loads(sys.stdin.read())['cities']['seattle'])" <<< "$foo"
# Bonus: use `jo` to create json:
foo="$(jo -p cities=$(jo boston=ma miami=fl seattle=wa))"
```
